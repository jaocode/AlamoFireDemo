# AlamoFireDemo
An example of AlamoFire + AlamoFireJsonToObjects written in Swift

This is a Swift iOS client for communicating with Luidog's Node-Express-API-Server (https://github.com/Luidog/Node-Express-API-Server) example. They were presented together at a local meetup to provide an overview of how to create a basic RESTful service and have a client communicate with it.

This project relies on cocoapods for the Alamofire and AlamoFireJsonToObjects dependencies.
